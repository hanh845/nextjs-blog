We’ve populated the index page with the blog data, but we still haven’t created individual blog pages yet (here’s the desired result). We want the URL for these pages to depend on the blog data, which means we need to use dynamic routes.

**What You’ll Learn in This Lesson**
In this lesson, you’ll learn:

- How to statically generate pages with dynamic routes using getStaticPaths.
- How to write getStaticProps to fetch the data for each blog post.
- How to render markdown using remark.
- How to pretty-print date strings.
- How to link to a page with dynamic routes.
- Some useful information on dynamic routes.
